# Python Data Structures Examples

This project demonstrates methods and operations for Python data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Each section provides interactive examples with animations to illustrate the concepts and requires user input to demonstrate different methods.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main page with navigation buttons to switch between data structures.
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for the project.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file to handle navigation and dynamic content loading.
- `examples/`: Contains HTML files with detailed examples for each data structure.
- `assets/animations/`: Contains additional animation styles.

## Features

- **Interactive Examples**: Users can view and interact with examples for each data structure.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations to enhance the user experience.
- **Dynamic Content**: Examples are loaded dynamically based on user selection.
